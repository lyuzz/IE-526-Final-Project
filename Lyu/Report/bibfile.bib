@article{Coelho2016,
abstract = {Distribution planning is crucial for most companies since goods are rarely produced and consumed at the same place. Distribution costs, in addition, can be an important component of the final cost of the products. In this paper, we study a VRP variant inspired on a real case of a large distribution company. In particular, we consider a VRP with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles that are allowed to perform multiple trips. The problem also includes docking constraints in which some vehicles are unable to serve some particular customers, and a realistic objective function with vehicles' fixed and distance-based costs and a cost per customer visited. We design a trajectory search heuristic called GILS-VND that combines Iterated Local Search (ILS), Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) procedures. This method obtains competitive solutions and improves the company solutions leading to significant savings in transportation costs.},

@article{Hiermann2016,
abstract = {Due to new regulations and further technological progress in the field of electric vehicles, the research community faces the new challenge of incorporating the electric energy based restrictions into vehicle routing problems. One of these restrictions is the limited battery capacity which makes detours to recharging stations necessary, thus requiring efficient tour planning mechanisms in order to sustain the competitiveness of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles. We introduce the Electric Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Recharging Stations (E-FSMFTW) to model decisions to be made with regards to fleet composition and the actual vehicle routes including the choice of recharging times and locations. The available vehicle types differ in their transport capacity, battery size and acquisition cost. Furthermore, we consider time windows at customer locations, which is a common and important constraint in real-world routing and planning problems. We solve this problem by means of branch-and-price as well as proposing a hybrid heuristic, which combines an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search with an embedded local search and labeling procedure for intensification. By solving a newly created set of benchmark instances for the E-FSMFTW and the existing single vehicle type benchmark using an exact method as well, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

@article{Lin2014,
abstract = {Green Logistics has emerged as the new agenda item in supply chain management. The traditional objective of distribution management has been upgraded to minimizing system-wide costs related to economic and environmental issues. Reflecting the environmental sensitivity of vehicle routing problems (VRP), an extensive literature review of Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) is presented. We provide a classification of GVRP that categorizes GVRP into Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem, VRP in Reverse Logistics, and suggest research gaps between its state and richer models describing the complexity in real-world cases. The purpose is to review the most up-to-date state-of-the-art of GVRP, discuss how the traditional VRP variants can interact with GVRP and offer an insight into the next wave of research into GVRP. It is hoped that OR/MS researchers together with logistics practitioners can be inspired and cooperate to contribute to a sustainable industry. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zhang2018,
abstract = {Due to growing environmental concerns about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, people are more incline to use electric vehicles in various distribution services. Because of the limited battery capacity, electric vehicles are required to visit recharging stations en-route. Therefore, the routing schemes of conventional vehicles may not be suitable as the routing schemes of electric vehicles. In this paper, the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) is introduced, and the corresponding mathematical model is formulated. The EVRP seeks to minimize the energy consumption of electric vehicles. The comprehensive calculation of energy consumption used by electric vehicles is provided in the EVRP model. An ant colony (AC) algorithm based meta-heuristics is proposed as the solution method of the EVRP. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated through extensive numerical experiments on the newly generated instances. We also illustrate the benefits of using an energy consumption-minimizing objective function rather than a distance-minimizing objective function for routing electric vehicles.},

A short overview of AnyLogic structure and scope is provided. A detailed description of a conceptual model with focus on input and output data is given. The structure of the simulation model and operation of its main blocks are described. Each vehicle is modelled as a separate object used to construct the overall schedule for all vehicles. The simulation model is used as a decision support tool for an analyst, which allows estimating efficiency of vehicle schedules with time windows generated by a standard software or/and modified by a planner.},
